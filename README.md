# KRivas_Timeseries_Final_Project
Kelton Rivas' final project for Time series at the University of Tennessee. This project analyses the search interest between two popular battle royales: Apex Legends and Fortnite. All information was downloaded from https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US

There are basic time series models such as: simple autoplots, naive, mean or drift models fitted to the table. You are able to select a tab on the left to view the associated output.  Additionally, there are also advanced models such as Holt's Winters, Auto ARIMA and Manual ARIMA models fitted to the data. 

I thoroughly enjoyed this project and learned a lot about both games. I hope to further improve this application in the future.
